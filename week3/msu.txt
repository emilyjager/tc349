There are some aspects that I like on the MSU homepage, but for the most part I think that it is clustered. There is so much going on with the colors and banner. I also think that the links underneath the main silver bar could have been incorporated better. (The one that starts with "students, faculty/staff.") It looks like it was just thrown in there at the end and doesn't fit with the other parts of the page.

I like that the columns underneath the banner are color coded (MSUview, MSUnews, Events). Even though the area seems clustered, it is easy to see those three sections and be able to tell the difference between the three. Another thing I like is how the banner scrolls through where the pictures come first and then the font scrolls on top a second later.
