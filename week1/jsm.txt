I really like how at the bottom of the site the black part is sectioned off and is always there as you look through parts of the site. I like that his bio and contact info are at the bottom because puts the focus more on the blog posts. But his info still stands out because the colors are opposite than the rest of the site.

I also like how everything is spaced out. The white space is evenly proportioned throughout the site. I like that the color scheme is simplistic and low key. It is easy to read the posts without squinting your eyes and I appreciate that.
