	I chose to use Chrome for my browser, because I already use it on a daily basis. I don't really like Safari, and I think Chrome is faster and a little more reliable than Firefox. I was having problems with Firefox a while back and since then have stuck with Chrome.
	I chose to use Textmate for my text editor. I have access to Dreamweaver, but I don't like how much space the program takes up on the screen with all of its buttons and random adobe crap. I really like how simplistic Textmate's interface is. The only thing I wish it did was auto complete tags like Dreamweaver does. I'm sure there is a shortcut, I just have to spend some time familiarizing myself with it.
