I really like the menu bar at the top of vimeo's page. That rainbow like border and their cursive logo really stick in your head. When I think of vimeo, I instantly bring those two things to mind. Another thing I really like about the menu bar is how it expands when you put your mouse over one of the sections to show the various topics in that section. Then when you move your mouse it disappears so that it's not taking up much space.


 I like that the setup is simple and the two columns work well for what they do. But, when you are logged in, some of the stuff on the right column is a little much. I don't think they really need to have the stats section permanently placed there. It would be cool if the right column was set up with widgets that you could move around and place in the order that you liked. Or at least have the option to mute some of the categories.

The main homepage when you aren't signed in, is really cool. They lay it all out right there and tell you why you should use their site to upload your videos, and I think they do a good job at showcasing their stuff. The bright colors are very inviting compared to their competitor youtube who's homepage is dull and somewhat overwhelming with just a bunch of videos.
