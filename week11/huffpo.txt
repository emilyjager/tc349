A website that I go to regularly on my iphone is The Huffington Post. They have one of the best mobile sites that I have come across. At the top of every page, there is a large search bar that is sometimes hidden by a section title, like "HuffPost Entertainment." You can toggle it on and off by pressing a magnifying glass icon when the section title is up, which opens up the search bar. The navigation bar only features a few sections, but it has a "more" option that brings up a page with upwards of twenty other sections. When you navigate to a particular section, there is a scrolling bar underneath the nav bar that shows topics within the section. The sections are well organized, and it is easy to find whatever topic you are looking for, or if you are just browsing you can easily see what is a hot topic or what is popular at the moment. 

On any given main page of a section (home, politics, entertainment, etc.) they have a large headline and picture of a popular article. Then they have sub sections such as top news, most popular and featured posts that spotlight articles in a sort of carousel type set up. It's not set on a timer like a picture carousel would be, you just scroll your finger left or right to browse. I like that they use this feature because it keeps everything on one page without the user having to continuously scroll down the page in order to find an article. 

Another thing that I like about their site, even though it's not limited to just mobile, is that they have a different color scheme for each section of the site. You can tell where you are at on the site just from looking at the colors of the headers, links, or background of the nav bar.
