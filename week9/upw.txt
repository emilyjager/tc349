My first impression of the UPW is that it has too much going on. There are so many boxes and the different colors on the t-shirts make it kind of overwhelming. I like the grid that they have in place, but I think they could tone down the amount of information on the homepage. They wouldn't necessarily have to remove the shirts from the page, they could just use a drop down method like the website from last week used to promote the brands they have worked with. Another thing that I don't like is how the newsletter signup, twitter link, blog posts, etc. just seem to be thrown in the middle of a bunch of shirt posts. They get lost in the pile and they don't seem to have any kind of organization here.  

The header and footer kind of make up for the messy organization of the grid. The newsletter and twitter links are reposted in the footer, and they both list the different site sections to help you navigate. I also like the interactivity of the homepage. I like how the shopping cart pops out and how the boxes pop up when you hover over them. It keeps the viewer engaged. 

The rest of the website seems to be organized well. I still think the shirts on the homepage could have easily just been teased there and then posted in their own section. There is the "pixilivery" section, but that seems to have different product than is shown on the homepage. Another thing about the pixilivery section is that you can't navigate back to the UPW site, you have to hit your back button. It seems like a no brainer that you should link back to the UPW site.
