I like that Etsy is simple and navigable. It is very easy to make your way around the site and find what you are looking for. I like how large the pictures are for items because you can clearly see what is for sale They do a much better job at this than Ebay, because on Ebay you almost always have to click through and even enlarge the photo to see what is on display.

I also like how they don't use very much space to advertise themselves. The only branding they have on the page is in the top left hand side. It is a small square and is part of the menu that leads you back to the homepage. I like that they let their service do the talking, and they don't try to put there name all over the place.
