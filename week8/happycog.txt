I like Happy Cog's simplicity. They get straight to the point in their header by telling potential customers exactly what they do. At first glance, their one column layout might seem like it will be hard to navigate the content that is on the page. However, the navigation bar is there to take you to it's designated section within the page. I really like that the navigation bar follows along at the top of the page as you scroll. Without that feature, it would be a hassle to have to scroll all the way back up to the top of the page to find the section that you are looking for. 

I like the way that they organized their content. They have work related topics first (work, news, and blog) and then company information (about, network, contact) follows. I think it was smart to have the work section first, because that is what may draw customers to choose them. If it would have been placed more towards the bottom, there is a chance that people wouldn't ever see it because they exited the site before getting to it. Having it at the very beginning helps to make sure people see it, and also to prove the company's validity right off the top. The first thing you see in the work section is a big square with an MTV logo and a paragraph about their collaboration with the network. I like that they only give a little bit of info and then if you want to see more about that project, you can click through to find out more. That way they are maintaining the amount of info that is present. If all of the info was there right when people click through to the website, it would be too overwhelming.
