	<h1>Card Sorting</h1>
		<h2>Personal Site</h2>
		<img src="cardsorting_personal.png"/>
			<p>The sorting began just like the first foldable sort. I supplied a list of content and groups (blog, content, home and media). There was an option for participants to create a new group if they felt like it was needed.</p>
			<p>I don't have a whole lot of content that I want to put on my site. I want it to be very simple and to the point so that I can spend most of my energy trying to make it look as professional as possible. When I sorted the content, instead of creating a separate about page, I wanted to use my homepage to display that information. Then I would have a contact info section (with email/social media links), a blog section (blog posts), and a media section (for videos that i have made). </p>
			<p>Since I don't have that much content planned, my participants followed my methods for the most part. One person added a separate page for my about me items. The only real disagreement happened with where to put pictures. I think that is mostly my fault because I didn't specify whether they are going to be pictures of myself, or pictures that I have taken/edited.</p>
