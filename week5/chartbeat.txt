I really like the about section on Chartbeat. Its cool how they showcase all their employees and show what they are working on/how many people are working at at the moment. They give out a vibe that they and their clients are one big community, and it makes you want to check them out.

I like the concept of the home page, but it feels very crowded. There is so much going on that at first glance it is hard to tell exactly what they do unless you already know the company. But, I don't think they really need to explain themselves to outsiders, because their products are for a niche market. I like how they have things built in to tell your location, how long you have been active on the page, and if you are currently idle. I've never seen that before.

I also like their color scheme. It is bright and upbeat, and it goes along with their cute shtick they have, like including dogs as "interns" under the employee section.
