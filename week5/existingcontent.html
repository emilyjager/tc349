	<h1>Card Sorting</h1>
		<h2>Foldable.me</h2>
		<img src="cardsorting_foldable.png"/>
			<p>The sorting began with a list of content. Participants were instructed to sort each item into their respective group (about us, contact us, create, and home). I had three other groups (basket, blog and giftcards) that were used on the site, but no one (including me) used them to place any of the items into, so they were taken off of the table in the results. I think those are still necessary groups, they just really only have one use and other sections don't fit into them.</p> 
	
			<p>My initial sorting differed only a little bit from the website. I put the foldable statistics and "how to" video in the create section instead of in the about section. I see those as components that go along with the process of making a foldable. They don't necessarily need to have their own pages, but I think they would be better fit maybe somewhere on the create a foldable page as little pop up widgets or something. I also put the information about free worldwide delivery on the home page because I think that's a good selling point. They have it hidden away in the about section.</p>
	
			<p>For the most part, the other participants also followed along with the site. Most agreed with me in putting delivery on the homepage and also with putting the foldable statistics/how to in the create section. One person put the how to on the homepage, which I think is a good idea because it showcases how it works and it might help attract people into buying if they can view it on the first page.</p>
