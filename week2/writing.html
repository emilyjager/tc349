	<h2>Critique</h2>
	<p>I like the Panic website because it is simple and to the point. They provide pictures/logos with links to each of their products. I like the little bubble that pops up when you hover over the pictures that explain what each product does. They aren't really trying to push themselves onto you. They're just saying "hey- this is what we do, check out our stuff, we're here if you need help with anything."</p>
