	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>Emily Jager is a student at Michigan State University.  She studies media and information and hopes to find a job in the television industry where her interests include editing and producing. In her spare time, she can be found catching up on her Netflix instant queue or laughing at gifs she finds on the Internet.

	<h2>Critique</h2>
	<p>I like the Panic website because it is simple and to the point. They provide pictures/logos with links to each of their products. I like the little bubble that pops up when you hover over the pictures that explain what each product does. They aren't really trying to push themselves onto you. They're just saying "hey- this is what we do, check out our stuff, we're here if you need help with anything."</p>
	<p>I also like that the size of the font and images/logos are much larger than normal. Since the site is so simplistic, they are able to make everything big and not make it seem overcrowded. The way that the site is set up also makes it easy to view on a tablet or smartphone. It looks the exact same on my computer as it does on my iPhone. I appreciate sites that take the time to make their site look and feel the same across devices. </p>
